# Age Prediction with Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This project is designed to predict the approximate age of individuals based on images using computer vision techniques. The solution was built for a network supermarket "Khleb-Sol," aiming to analyze customer age demographics for targeted recommendations and ensuring cashier compliance in age-restricted sales.

## Project Objective
The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the age of individuals in images. The model leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn from a dataset of annotated images with real ages, aiming for a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 8 on the validation set.

## Project Structure

- **Dataset**: 
    - The dataset is based on the "ChaLearn Looking at People" collection and contains images and real ages.
    - It consists of 7,591 images in the `/final_files` folder, with labels stored in `labels.csv`.

- **Data Exploration**: 
    - Analyzed distribution of ages in the dataset.
    - Identified potential data imbalance, with a higher representation of younger individuals compared to older ones.
  
- **Preprocessing**:
    - Resizing images to a fixed size of 150x150 pixels.
    - Data augmentation techniques applied to introduce variability and improve model robustness.
  
- **Model Architecture**:
    - A pre-trained ResNet50 model was used as the backbone with additional dense layers.
    - Fine-tuning involved unfreezing the top layers of ResNet and reducing the learning rate to improve generalization.

- **Training and Validation**:
    - The model achieved **MAE on training data**: 3.64 and **MAE on validation data**: 6.94, meeting the project's accuracy goals.
    - Dropout layers were used to prevent overfitting, and data augmentation helped improve model performance on unseen images.

## Requirements

The project requires the following libraries:

- `tensorflow`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_link>
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Training Script**:
   To train the model, run:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. **Inference**:
    - The model can predict the age of a person in an image by running:
    ```python
    python inference.py --image_path <path_to_image>
    ```

## Results and Observations

- The model demonstrates a lower MAE on the training dataset than on the validation set, indicating a balanced training process with room for improvement in generalization.
- A clear age distribution bias towards younger individuals was noted, suggesting potential improvements by rebalancing the dataset or focusing on data augmentation for underrepresented age groups.

## Future Improvements

1. **Address Data Imbalance**: Implement synthetic oversampling or targeted data augmentation for older age groups.
2. **Enhanced Preprocessing**: Improve image quality or remove background noise to focus more on facial features.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Explore further optimizations in learning rate, optimizer selection, and network depth.
